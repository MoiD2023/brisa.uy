This morning brings west wind. The sun rose over this little islet to the
east. Listening to the nets. Getting ready to shove-off for Santa Rosalía.
Having those sad feelings of summer over back to school.
And back to school it will be. Going to do some sailing.
An adventure. Excited and anxious as usual.

Running east broad on port quarter with two foot swell rolling the boat,
preventer doing its job. Ten knots of wind, gentle to moderate.
This is the real deal now. We're sailing. I'll jibe when I'm clear of
Punta las Animas. The boat sounds different now. With the door closed
in the head I feel like I'm a submarine-- water bubling, splashing.
In the cabin, the boat rocks. I can hear the sheets on the stays,
blocks rattling, the foresail giving and taking, slacking and filling
as the boat rolls in the swell. Creeks and bumps here and there.
I'm constantly thirsty and peeing nervously, but I'll be alright.
I'd like to be going faster but stronger winds are forecast. I don't
want to change the headsail.

Nibi is ahead of me down by the point. She left as I was raising anchor.
They flew a genoa for a while, or a spini, straight downwind into
Bahía de las Animus, then put the wind on the beam to clear the point.
I'm good. Doing my thing. That little cat is so much faster. They're two
experienced sailors. Gently now. I'll get there. Miss having a smoke to keep
me company while I sit and watch the sea go by.

Nibi is going down over the horizon. I'll lose her soon.
Running wing-on-wing now and more comfortable. Relatively.
Heard Alan and Margie on VHF. Didn't call them although felt like doing
that. Felt homesick.

I could put up the spinaker or giant genoa. Then I'd be flying.
Don't dare. Maybe the drifter. But I'll chill. I'v rediscovered what I
knew before. Downwind sailing I'm better off without the main sail.
This might not be true with the spinaker up, but is certainly true otherwise.
There. I experimented. Now I know. We'll see about the spini one day.

Just going above, it's lovely. Sunny. Pretty water. Beautiful mountains.
Nice breeze. The boat rocks in motion, parting the waters and pushing
along before the wind.

I miss the wind vane. It steers more comfortably than Otto does in a
following sea.

It got very rough in the enterance to Canal Salsipuedes. The waves became
quite steep, sometimes higher than eye level seated in the cockpit at the
helm, and sometimes a little crossed. The boat rolled thirty degrees
to port and then thirty to starboard occasionally, wreaking havoc below.
Everything on the chart table was on the floor. Fortunately, I'd stowed the
camera.

Now things have settled to four or five foot swells, not so steep.
I'll be out of the channel in a couple of hours.

I'm practicing staying below twenty minutes at a time.
It's hard not to get up and look outside.
I do look at the chart plotter.
I heated something to eat, leftovers, and cleaned-up.
Trying to do normal stuff.

Had quite a rock and rolly night on the staysail headed downwind.
It felt violent sometimes.
Of course, that's the kind of seas forecast. Four to six feet with six second
period is pretty "square". And that's the average of the highest third.
Sometimes the waves come higher. That's when I get banged around.

I'll be a little punchy on account of cat-napping all night.
No deep or prolonged sleep.
I don't think that's a sustainable way to handle the single-handed watch.
How long could I keep that up?
